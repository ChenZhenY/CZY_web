I am interested in robotics. Control and playing with dynamics is one of the most beautiful things in the nature, especially in animals movements and in human sports. Building hardware and design control algorithms to replicate those behaviors in robots is a goal of mine, which can also help us understand the science behind mother nature.

I am currently first year MS Robotics student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). I got my bachelor degree in robotics engineering at Southern University of Science and Technology [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/) and studying at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) in my senior year. Outside class and lab, I enjoy Mountain Biking, racing drones, hiking, chatting with people.
