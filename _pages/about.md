I am a guy interested in robotics. Control and playing with dynamics is one of the most beautiful things in the nature, for examples in animals movements and in human sports. Building hardware and design control algorithms to replicate those behaviors in robots can help us understand the science behind it.


I am currently senior student majoring in robotics engineering at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) and studying at MIT in my senior year. Outside class and lab, I enjoy Mountain Biking, racing drones, hiking, chatting with people.
