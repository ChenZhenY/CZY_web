Some resources to build a personal web.

Time for Web Rookie
======

Yes, I am the web rookie. With the help from [Cindy](https://cindychow123.github.io/), I explored the basic concepts and use the academic [template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) to build my own website.

Concept time
-----
If you are also a rookie, this concept might be helpful. But if you just want to substitute the content in the template without changing other things, you can ignore this part too.

1. [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static websites generator. It helps transfer the text content and layout to websites. If you hope to preview the website on local machine, you should install it. Or you can also let gitpages help you do that online (but need to push your code and wait for sometimes). Installing it on mac is easy, but installing it on windows can be a pain.
2. [html](https://www.w3schools.com/html/): hyper text markup language. You can use it to design the website **components and contents**.
3. [css](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/): Cascading Style Sheets. With html element, you can use css to determine **how to display them** (font, color, size etc.)
4. [javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/DEFAULT.asp): define the website behavior.
